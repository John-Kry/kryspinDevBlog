Let's imagine you are working a typical 9-5 job as a developer. You arrive to the office (or your home office due to COVID-19) at 8:55. You browse through your email and get into the right mindset to being your day. Maybe a hot cup of coffee is brewing as you start to ease into your day.

Looking at your calendar you see two short meetings for today; one to go over a new feature the client wants and another for your teams daily standup. As the clock strikes 9 you are already writing a new component and working on some back end APIs. Your friend pings you a meme and you gladly reply with an even better meme. A few minutes later you are locked into your flow state. With your headphones blasting progressive house music you type out 78 lines of code making sure to handle all cases. Two hours into your coding flow you join your team standup at 11am ready to share all the progress you've made on your feature.

Unfortunately or fortunately depending on your perspective this is not the case for many developers. There are consistently interruptions which break you out of your flow. Perhaps someone needs help understanding how to access a server or there is some issue affecting production.

As a teammate there are many expectations of yourself outside of programming and development. Maybe you only are able to sit down and code for an hour a day.

This brings into play something I call "Forced Time Management".

I do not have much time management skills. In college I always stayed up the night before something was due. I suppose that is what most people do, it seemed pretty typical as a college student.

But, at IBM and DraftKings you do not have that same opportunity to wait until the last minute. You need to show good progression each day, and if you wait until the last day before starting, that is a sure way to introduce a bug into the code or to get absolutely ravaged during peer review.

At theses companies you tend to do things each day, because if you do not, it is impossible to succeed in a "lets do it all the night before". 

In addition, you are also riddled with meetings. Thus for the 8 hours of the work day you are constantly either coding or in meetings. This leads to another symptom of "Forced Time Management". 

If you do not want to work 10 hour days, you better be sure to make the time spent at work actually working.

I think that being a professional programmer means both getting things done on time, and being sure that the hours you put in are efficient.

There is not time in the day to not be efficient, we as developers are Forced to have stellar Time Management.
