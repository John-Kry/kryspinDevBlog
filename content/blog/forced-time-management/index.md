Let's imagine you are working a typical 9-5 job as a developer. You arrive to the office (or your home office due to COVID-19) at 8:55. You browse through your email and get into the right mindset to being your day. Maybe a hot cup of coffee is brewing as you start to ease into your day.

Looking at your calendar you see two short meetings for today; one to go over a new feature the client wants and another for your teams daily standup. As the clock strikes 9 you are already writing a new component and working on some back end APIs. Your friend pings you a meme and you gladly reply with an even better meme. A few minutes later you are locked into your flow state. With your headphones blasting progressive house music you type out 78 lines of code making sure to handle all cases. Two hours into your coding flow you join your team standup at 11am ready to share all the progress you've made on your feature.

Unfortunately or fortunately depending on your perspective this is not the case for many developers. There are consistently interruptions which break you out of your flow. Perhaps someone needs help understanding how to access a server or there is some issue affecting production
